# Kaggle repository

### Overall description
The repository contains projects based on datasets found on Kaggle. 

### Projects:
1.  **Portuguese bank.** There has been a revenue decline in the Portuguese Bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found that the root cause was that their customers are not investing enough for long term deposits. So the bank would like to identify existing customers that have a higher chance to subscribe for a long term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such customers.
The problem I was dealing with was a classification problem. In the project the next steps had been performed: 
* EDA; 
* Dealing with outliers; 
* Dealing with missing data; 
* Encoding categorical variables; 
* Dealing with imbalanced classes; 
* Scaling and Feature Importances. 

Next Machine Learning algorithms for the classification had been used:
* KNN;
* Random Forest Classifier. 

2. **Shill Bidding.** Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this process is termed as a 'bid'. Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. The goal is to use classification or clustering algorithms to predict the bids in the future.
The problem I was dealing with was a classification problem. In the project the next steps had been performed: 
* Data preparation;
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA and LDA).  

Next Machine Learning algorithms for the classification had been used:
* Logistic Regression;
* Decision Tree Classifier.
